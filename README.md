# QLever

QLever (pronounced "clever") is a query engine for efficient combined search on a knowledge base and a text corpus, in which named entities from the knowledge base have been identified.
The query language is SPARQL extended by an `in-text` predicate, where `?x <in-text> ?t` means that the word or entity `?x` occurs in text record `?t`.
Pure SPARQL is supported as well.

With this, it is possible to answer queries like the following one for astronauts who walked on the moon:

    SELECT ?a TEXT(?t) SCORE(?t) WHERE {
        ?a <is-a> <Astronaut> . 
        ?a <in-text> ?t .
        ?t <in-text> "walk* moon"
    } ORDER BY DESC(SCORE(?t))
    
This Readme sets you up to use the engine and to quickly build and query your own index.

## Research paper

Our paper [QLever: A Query Engine for Efficient SPARQL+Text Search](http://ad-publications.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/CIKM_qlever_BB_2017.pdf) has been accepted to [CIKM 2017](http://cikm2017.org/) and will appear in the conference proceeding! Fortunately the publisher allows us to publish the paper on our homepage.

The paper describes the research behind QLever, how it works, and most importantly contains an evaluation where we compare QLever to state-of-the-art SPARQL engines. Query times are competitive and often faster on the pure SPARQL queries, and several orders of magnitude faster on the SPARQL+Text queries.

# How to use


## 0. Requirements:


Make sure you use a 64bit Linux with:

* git
* g++ 4.8 or higher
* CMake 2.8.4 or higher
* google-sparsehash

Other compilers (and OS) are not supported, yet. 
So far no major problems are known. 
Support for more platforms would be a highly appreciated contribution.

You also have to have google sparsehash installed.
If this isn't the case on your system, run:

    git clone https://github.com/sparsehash/sparsehash.git
    cd  sparsehash
    ./configure && make && sudo make install

## 1. Build:


a) Checkout this project:

    git clone https://github.com/Buchhold/QLever.git --recursive

Don't forget --recursive so that submodules will be updated. 
For old versions of git, that do not support this parameter, you can do:

    git clone https://github.com/Buchhold/QLever.git
    cd QLever
    git submodule init
    git submodule update
    

b) Go to a folder where you want to build the binaries.
Don't do this directly in QLever

    cd /path/to/YOUR_FOLDER

c) Build the project (Optional: add -DPERFTOOLS_PROFILER=True/False and -DALLOW_SHUTDOWN=True/False)

    cmake /path/to/QLever/ -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release; make -j

d) Run ctest. All tests should pass:

    ctest


## 2. Creating an Index:


IMPORTANT:
THERE HAS TO BE SUFFICIENT DISK SPACE UNDER THE PATH YOU CHOOSE FOR YOUR INDEX!
FOR NOW - ALL FILES HAVE TO BE UTF-8 ENCODED!

    You can use the files described and linked later in this document: 
    "How to obtain data to play around with"

a) from an NTriples file (currently no blank nodes allowed):

Note that the string passed to -i is the base name of various index files produced.

    ./IndexBuilderMain -i /path/to/myindex -n /path/to/input.nt

b) from a TSV File (no spaces / tabs in spo):

    ./IndexBuilderMain -i /path/to/myindex -t /path/to/input.tsv 

To include a text collection, the wordsfile (see below for the required format) has to be passed with -w.
To support text snippets, a docsfile (see below for the required format)has to be passed with -d

The full call will look like this:

    ./IndexBuilderMain -i /path/to/myindex -n /path/to/input.nt -w /path/to/wordsfile -d /path/to/docsfile 
    
If you want support for SPARQL queries with predicate variables  (perfectly normal for SPARQL but rarely used in semantic text queries), use an optional argument -a to build all permutations:

    ./IndexBuilderMain -i /path/to/myindex -n /path/to/input.nt -a -w 

If you want some literals to be written to an on disk vocabulary (by default this concerns literals longer than 50 chars and literals in less frequent lagnuages), add an topional parameter -l. This is useful for large knowledge bases that included texts (descriptions etc) as literals and thus consume lots of memory on startup without this option.

    ./IndexBuilderMain -i /path/to/myindex -n /path/to/input.nt -l
    
You can also add a text index to an existing knowledge base index by ommitting -n and -t parameters (for KB input)

    ./IndexBuilderMain -i /path/to/myindex -w /path/to/wordsfile -d /path/to/docsfile
    
All options can, of course, be combined. The full call with all permutations and literals on disk will look like this:
                                         
    ./IndexBuilderMain -a -l -i /path/to/myindex -n /path/to/input.nt -w /path/to/wordsfile -d /path/to/docsfile

## 3. Starting a Sever:

a) Without text collection:

    ./ServerMain -i /path/to/myindex -p <PORT>

b) With text collection:

    ./ServerMain -i /path/to/myindex -p <PORT> -t

Depending on if you built the index with the -a version, two or six index permutations will be registered.
For some data this can be a significant difference in memory consumption.

If you built an index using the -l and/or -a options, make sure to include it at startup

    ./ServerMain -i /path/to/myindex -p <PORT> -t -a -l

## 4. Running queries:

    curl 'http://localhost:<PORT>/?query=SELECT ?x WHERE {?x <rel> ?y}'

or visit:

    http://localhost:<PORT>/index.html
    
## 5. Text Features

### 5.1 Input Data

The following two input files are needed for full feature support:

#### a) Wordsfile

A tab-separated file with one line per posting and following the format:

    word    isEntity    recordId   score
        
For example, for a sentence `He discovered penicillin, a drug.`, it could look like this:

    He                  0   0   1
    <Alexander_Fleming> 1   0   1
    dicovered           0   0   1
    penicillin          0   0   1
    <Penicillin>        1   0   1
    penicillin          0   1   1
    <Penicillin>        1   1   1
    a                   0   1   1
    drug                0   1   1

Note that some form of entity recognition / linking has been done.
This file is used to build the text index from.

#### b) Docsfile

A tab-separated file with one line per original unit of text and following the format:

    max_record_id  text
    
For example, for the sentence above:

    1   He discovered penicillin, a drug.
    
Note that this file is only used to display proper excerpts as evidence for texttual matches.



### 5.2 Supported Queries


Typical SPARQL queries can then be augmented. The features are best explained using examples:

A query for plants with edible leaves:

    SELECT ?plant WHERE { 
        ?plant <is-a> <Plant> . 
        ?plant <in-text> ?t . 
        ?t <in-text> "'edible' 'leaves'"
    } 
    
The special relation `<in-text>` to state that results for `?plant` have to occur in a text record `?t`.
In records matching `?t`, there also have to be both words `edible` and `leaves`.
Note that the single quotes can also be omitted and will be in further examples.
Single quotes are necessary to mark phrases (which are not supported yet, but may be in the future).

A query for Astronauts who walked on the moon:

    SELECT ?a TEXT(?t) SCORE(?t) WHERE {
        ?a <is-a> <Astronaut> . 
        ?a <in-text> ?t .
        ?t <in-text> "walk* moon"
    } ORDER BY DESC(SCORE(?t))
    TEXTLIMIT 2
    
Note the following features:

* A star `*` can be used to search for a prefix as done in the keyword `walk*`. Note that there is a min prefix size depending on settings at index build-time.
* `SCORE` can be used to obtain the score of a text match. This is important to achieve a good ordering in the result. The typical way would be to `ORDER BY DESC(SCORE(?t))`.
* Where `?t` just matches a text record Id, `TEXT(?t)` can be used to extract a snippet.
* `TEXTLIMIT` can be used to control the number of result lines per text match. The default is 1.

An alternative query for astronauts who walked on the moon:

    SELECT ?a TEXT(?t) SCORE(?t) WHERE {
        ?a <is-a> <Astronaut> . 
        ?a <in-text> ?t .
        ?t <in-text> "walk* <Moon>"
    } ORDER BY DESC(SCORE(?t))

This query doesn't search for an occurrence of the word moon but played where the entity `<Moon>` has been linked.


Text / Knowledge-base data can be nested in queries. This allows queries like one for politicians that were friends with a scientist associated with the manhattan project:

    SELECT ?p TEXT(?t) ?s TEXT(?t2) WHERE {
        ?p <is-a> <Politician> .
        ?p <in-text> ?t .
        ?t <in-text> friend* .
        ?t <in-text> ?s .
        ?s <is-a> <Scientist> .
        ?s <in-text> ?t2 .
        ?t2 <in-text> "manhattan project"
    } ORDER BY DESC(SCORE(?t))


For now, each text-record variable is required to have a triple `<in-text> ENTITY/WORD`. 
Pure connections to variables (e.g. "Books with a description that mentions a plant.") are planned for the future.



# How to obtain data to play around with

## Use the tiny examples contained in the repository


These are tiny and there's nothing meaningful to discover.
They are fine for setting up a working sever within seconds and getting comfortable with the query language:

    QLever/misc/tiny-example.kb.nt
    QLever/misc/tiny-example.wordsfile.tsv
    QLever/misc/tiny-example.docsfile.tsv
    
Note that we left out stopwords (unlike in the docsfile) to demonstrate how this can be done if desired.
If you build an index using these files and ask the query:

    SELECT ?x TEXT(?t) WHERE {
        ?x <is-a> <Scientist> .
        ?x <in-text> ?t .
        ?t <in-text> "penicillin"
    }  ORDER BY DESC(SCORE(?t))
    
You should find `<Alexander_Fleming>` and the textual evidence for that match.

You can also display his awards or find `<Albert_Einstein>` and his awards with the following query:

    SELECT ?x ?award TEXT(?t) WHERE {
        ?x <is-a> <Scientist> .
        ?x <in-text> ?t .
        ?t <in-text> "theory rela*" .
        ?x <Award_Won> ?award
    }  ORDER BY DESC(SCORE(?t))

have a look at the (really tiny) input files to get a feeling for how this works.

Curl-versions (ready for copy&paste) of the queries:

    SELECT ?x TEXT(?t) WHERE \{ ?x <is-a> <Scientist> . ?x <in-text> ?t . ?t <in-text> \"penicillin\" \} ORDER BY DESC(SCORE(?t))    

    SELECT ?x ?award TEXT(?t) WHERE \{ ?x <is-a> <Scientist> . ?x <in-text> ?t . ?t <in-text> \"theory rela*\" . ?x <Award_Won> ?award \}  ORDER BY DESC(SCORE(?t))
    
Again, there's not much to be done with this data.
For a meaningful index, use the example data below.

## Download prepared input files for a collection about scientists

These files are of medium size (facts about scientists - only one hop from a scientist in a knowledge graph. Text are Wikipedia articles about scientists.)
Includes a knowledge base as nt file, and a words- and docsfile as tsv. 

[scientist-collection.zip](http://filicudi.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/bjoern-data/scientist-collection.zip):

* 78 MB zipped
* 318 MB unzipped
* 350 k facts
* 11.7 m text postings

Here is a sample query to try and check if everything worked for you:

    SELECT ?x SCORE(?t) TEXT(?t) WHERE {
        ?x <is-a> <Scientist> .
        ?x <in-text> ?t .
        ?t <in-text> "relati*"
    }
    ORDER BY DESC(SCORE(?t))

Curl-version (ready for copy&paste) of the query:

    SELECT ?x SCORE(?t) TEXT(?t) WHERE \{ ?x <is-a> <Scientist> . ?x <in-text> ?t . ?t <in-text> \"relati*\" \} ORDER BY DESC(SCORE(?t))

## Download prepared input for English Wikipedia text and a KB derived from Freebase


Includes a knowledge base as nt file, and a words- and docsfile as tsv.
Text and facts are basically equivalent to the [Broccoli](http://broccoli.cs.uni-freiburg.de) search engine. 

[wikipedia-freebase.zip](http://filicudi.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/bjoern-data/wikipedia-freebase.zip):

* 21 GB zipped
* 103 GB unzipped
* 372 million facts
* 2.8 billion text postings

Here is a sample query to try and check if everything worked for you:

    SELECT ?x SCORE(?t) TEXT(?t) WHERE {
        ?x <is-a> <Astronaut> .
        ?x <in-text> ?t .
        ?t <in-text> "walk* moon"
    }
    ORDER BY DESC(SCORE(?t))

Curl-version (ready for copy&paste) of the query:

    SELECT ?x SCORE(?t) TEXT(?t) WHERE \{ ?x <is-a> <Astronaut> . ?x <in-text> ?t . ?t <in-text> \"walk* moon\" \} ORDER BY DESC(SCORE(?t))

## Use any knowledge base and text collection of your choice

 
Create the files similar to the three files provided as sample downloads for other data sets.
Usually, knowledge base files do not have to be changed. Only words- and docsfile have to be produced.


# Convenience features


## Statistics:


You can get stats for the currently active index in the following way:

    <server>:<port>/?cmd=stats
    
This query will yield a JSON response that features:

* The name of the KB index
* The number of triples in the KB index
* The number of index permutations build (usually 2 or 6)
* The numbers of distinct subjects, predicates and objects (only available if 6 permutations are built)
* The name of the text index (if one is present)
* The number of text records in the text index (if text index present)
* The number of word occurrences/postings in the text index (if text index present)
* The number of entity occurrences/postings in the text index (if text index present)


The names of a index is the name of the input nt file (and wordsfile for the text index) but can also be specified manually while building an index.
Therefore, IndexbuilderMain takes two optional arguments: --text-index-name (-T) and --kb-index-name (-K).


## Send vs Compute

Currently, QLever does not compute partial results if there is a LIMIT modifier.
However, strings (for entities and text excerpts) are only resolved for those items that are actually send.
Furthermore, in a UI, it is usually beneficial to get less than all result rows by default.

While it is recommended for applications to specify a LIMIT, some experiments want to measure the time to produce the full result but not block the UI.
Therefore an additional HTTP parameter "&send=<x>" can be used to only send x result rows but to compute the fully readable result for everything according to LIMIT.
 
**IMPORTANT: Unless you want to measure QLever's performance, using LIMIT (+ OFFSET for sequential loading) should be preferred in all applications. That way should be faster and standard SPARQL without downsides.** 


# Troubleshooting


If you have problems, try to rebuild when compiling with -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug.
In particular also rebuild the index. 
The release build assumes machine written words- and docsfiles and omits sanity checks for the sake of speed.
